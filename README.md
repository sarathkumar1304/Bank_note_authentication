# Bank_note_authentication

##Problem Statement

Machine learning algorithms learn from the dataset. Therefore, to identify whether a banknote is real or not, we needed a dataset of real as well as fake banknotes along with their different features.

Some sources to download a free dataset are Kaggle, UCI machine learning repository, etc.

We know that data is messy. A dataset may contain multiple missing values. In that situation, we have to clean the dataset. To avoid this kind of hassle we are going to use a pre-cleaned dataset. You can download the dataset (.CSV file) from my Github repository. Hereâ€™s the link (GitHub)

The aim is to predict whether a given banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph.

Whenever you go to the bank to deposit some cash, the cashier places banknotes in a machine that tells whether a banknote is genuine or counterfeit. The machine uses some classification techniques to do it. There are many machine learning algorithms for classification. Classification is a type of supervised machine learning. There are multiple machine learning algorithms in the classification. We understand it's hard to know the theoretical concept of each algorithm as a beginner. If it's true for you, there is nothing to panic about.ðŸ¤ª
